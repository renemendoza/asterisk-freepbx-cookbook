Description
===========

Installs Asterisk 1.8 on Debian/Ubuntu and configures it to
be ready to be used with a FreePBX 2.9.0 new installation

Based on work by Christopher Peplin

Changes
=======

Requirements
============

## Platform:

* Ubuntu and Debian, 64 bit (amd64/x86\_64)

Other platforms can be used but you'll need to modify the default recipe.

Attributes
==========

There are a number of attributes defined in the cookbook, but the defaults are 
pretty sane. You probably don't need to change any of them to get a working
setup.

However, you'll need to configure two data bags. The `asterisk` data bag should
contain your desired Asterisk accounts (I've only tested it with one) defined
like this:

    id:         <your desired username>
    data_bag:   asterisk
    extension:  <the extension # for your PBX line, I just use 101>
    full_name:  <full display name>
    password:   <your desired password>
    username:   <your desired username>

Usage
=====

Include the asterisk default recipe in a role run list.

    name "role_for_asterisk"
    run_list("recipe[asterisk]")

Once Asterisk is installed, you should be able to open any SIP client (like
Ekiga in Ubuntu) and connect to it using the account you set up in the
`asterisk` data bag.
